# 1. Introduction and Setup

> _Welcome to the first lesson of HTML for Absolute Beginners 2025! In this video, we'll cover the fundamentals of HTML and set up our development environment._

## What is HTML?

> _HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's not a programming language, just a markup language which specifies where the elements should be positioned on a webpage._

## The browser only understands three core technologies:

1. #### **HTML** (Structure)
2. #### **CSS** (Styling)
3. #### **JavaScript** (Functionality)

> _When you visit any website, it sends you a bundle of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that your browser processes and displays._

## Understanding HTML with a Car Example üöó

Let us take an example of a car. A car consists of 3 main things:

- #### **Body** = HTML (The structure and framework)
- #### **Design** = CSS (Colors of doors, tires, rims, interior styling)
- #### **Engine** = JavaScript (How it accelerates, brakes, and functions)

> _Just like a car needs all three components to work properly, a website needs HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to be fully functional._

## Framework Reality Check

> _Every web framework like React, Vue, Next.js, or anything else works behind the scenes with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They're just tools that make writing these core technologies easier and more organized._

## Here's the fundamental HTML structure every webpage needs:

```html
html<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
		<title>My First Webpage</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```
